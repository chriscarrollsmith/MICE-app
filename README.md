# MICE Storytelling Framework (App)

This app is a visual workspace for building stories using the **MICE Quotient** framing:

- **Milieu**: the world and its rules (enter when you cross into a place; exit when you leave it).
- **Idea**: a question, mystery, or investigation (enter when a question is posed; exit when it’s answered).
- **Character**: an internal arc of change (enter when a character’s flaw/need is in play; exit when it resolves).
- **Event**: external conflict and its consequences (enter when the central situation starts; exit when it ends).

The canvas is designed to make **nested arcs** and **interleaved threads** visible, so you can track where each thread starts, how it develops, and what “closes” it.
